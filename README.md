## Highlight to Explain ðŸŒŸðŸ¤© 

Content Caddy introduces a powerful new feature called **Highlight to Explain!** This feature allows you to highlight any word or phrase on a website to get a contextual explanation, enhancing your browsing experience.

To use the feature:

1. Generate an OpenAI API key by following the instructions on the [OpenAI website.](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Click on the Content Caddy extension icon to open the popup, then go to the Settings tab.
3. Click on the `"Add a new key"` button and enter your OpenAI API key.
4. Click on `"Save"` to save your changes.

With your API key added, you can now highlight any word or phrase on a website, click on the explain icon, and get a brief definition or explanation. The explanations provided by OpenAI are detailed and accurate, making it easier to comprehend website content.
